## problem_0042 unsolved
The _n_ th term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, _t n_ = Â½ _n_
( _n_ +1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For
example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = _t_ 10. If the word
value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using [words.txt][1] (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text
file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are
triangle words?
