Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:

_x_ 2 – D _y_ 2 = 1

For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in _x_ is 6492 – 13×1802 = 1.

It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is
square.

By finding minimal solutions in _x_ for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the
following:

32 – 2×22 = 1  
22 – 3×12 = 1  
92 – 5×42 = 1  
52 – 6×22 = 1  
82 – 7×32 = 1

Hence, by considering minimal solutions in _x_ for D ≤ 7, the largest _x_ is
obtained when D=5.

Find the value of D ≤ 1000 in minimal solutions of _x_ for which the largest
value of _x_ is obtained.
