Consider the fraction, _n/d_ , where _n_ and _d_ are positive integers. If _n_
< _d_ and HCF( _n,d_ )=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for _d_ ≤ 8 in ascending order
of size, we get:

1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3,
5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8

It can be seen that there are 21 elements in this set.

How many elements would be contained in the set of reduced proper fractions
for _d_ ≤ 1,000,000?
