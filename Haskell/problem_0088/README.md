A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set
of at least two natural numbers, { _a_ 1, _a_ 2, ... , _a_ _k_ } is called a
product-sum number: N = _a_ 1 \+ _a_ 2 \+ ... + _a_ _k_ = _a_ 1 × _a_ 2 × ...
× _a_ _k_.

For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3.

For a given set of size, _k_ , we shall call the smallest N with this property
a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of
size, _k_ = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows.

_k_ =2: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2 + 2  
 _k_ =3: 6 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 1 + 2 + 3  
 _k_ =4: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4  
 _k_ =5: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2  
 _k_ =6: 12 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6

Hence for 2≤ _k_ ≤6, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is
4+6+8+12 = 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.

In fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤ _k_ ≤12 is
{4, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16}, the sum is 61.

What is the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤ _k_ ≤12000?
