## problem_0091 unsolved
The points P ( _x_ 1, _y_ 1) and Q ( _x_ 2, _y_ 2) are plotted at integer co-
ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ.

![][1]  

There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be
formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,  
0 ≤ _x_ 1, _y_ 1, _x_ 2, _y_ 2 ≤ 2.

Given that 0 ≤ _x_ 1, _y_ 1, _x_ 2, _y_ 2 ≤ 50, how many right triangles can
be formed?
